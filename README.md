\# ðŸŽˆ Bloomberg Terminal - Balloon Trading Game



A fake Bloomberg Terminal with a risky balloon game. How greedy can you get before it pops?



\## Getting Started



Just run `start.bat` and you're good to go!



\## Commands



Type these in the command line:

\- `HELP` - See all commands

\- `NEWS` - Read funny headlines

\- `PORTFOLIO` - View your ridiculous investments

\- `BALLOON` - Start the game!

\- `CLEAR` - Clear console



\## The Balloon Game



\*\*The Deal:\*\* Press spacebar to pump the balloon. Each pump = Â£0.20. But it'll randomly pop between 5-30 pumps and you lose everything for that round.



\*\*Controls:\*\*

\- \*\*SPACEBAR\*\* - Pump it up

\- \*\*R\*\* - Cash out (keep your money)



\*\*The Catch:\*\* You never know when it'll pop. Cash out early and play it safe, or keep pumping and risk losing it all. Classic risk vs reward.



You get unlimited rounds, so your total keeps building as long as you cash out before the pop.



\## Tips



\- The balloon changes color and size as you pump (yellow = danger zone)

\- Your total earnings carry over between rounds

\- There's no "safe" number - it's always random

\- Best strategy? That's for you to figure out



\## What Else?



The terminal has fake stock tickers that update in real-time, scrolling news at the bottom, and a fake portfolio full of terrible investments. It's all just decoration for the balloon game, but it looks pretty cool.
